        <p>While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes, and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some <a href="#" data-sidenote="<strong>Conversation:</strong> the informal exchange of ideas by spoken words: “the two men were deep in conversation”.">conversation</a> ensued between them.</p>
        <p>“I <a href="#" data-sidenote="<strong>Wonder:</strong> a feeling of surprise mingled with admiration, caused by something beautiful, unexpected, unfamiliar, or inexplicable: “he had stood in front of it, observing the intricacy of the ironwork with the wonder of a child.”">wonder</a> what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,” said Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a <a href="#" data-sidenote="<strong>Leviathan:</strong> a very large aquatic creature, especially a whale: “the great leviathans of the deep.”">leviathan</a>.</p>
        <p>“Wants with it?” said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat’s bow, “did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale's head hoisted on her <a href="#" data-sidenote="<strong>Starboard:</strong> the side of a ship or aircraft that is on the right when one is facing forward.">starboard</a> side, and at the same time a Right Whale’s on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can never afterwards capsize?”</p>

        <p>“Why not?”</p>

        <p>I don’t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so, and he seems to know all about ships’ charms. But I sometimes think he’ll charm the ship to no good at last. I don’t half like that chap, Stubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake’s head, Stubb?”</p>

        <p>Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a dark night, and he standing hard by the <a href="#" data-sidenote="<strong>Bulwarks:</strong> a person, institution, or principle that acts as a defense: “the security forces are a bulwark against the breakdown of society.”">bulwarks</a>, and no one by; look down there, Flask—pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hands—Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in disguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship? He’s the devil, I say. The reason why you don’t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries it coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of it, he’s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.</p>

        <p>He sleeps in his boots, don’t he? He hasn’t got any hammock; but I’ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.</p>

        <p>No doubt, and it’s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye see, in the eye of the rigging. Because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries it coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of it, he’s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots."</p>
